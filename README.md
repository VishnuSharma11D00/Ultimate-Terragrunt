# Ultimate Terragrunt Setup for Serverless Architecture on AWS

This project demonstrates how to build and manage a **serverless architecture on AWS** using **Terragrunt**, **Terraform**, and **GitHub Actions**, following best DevOps practices.
It automates environment provisioning, manages separate states for each module, and includes CI/CD integration with GitHub workflows.

---

## üß© Project Overview

This repository shows how to:

- Use **Terragrunt** to manage Terraform modules and state per environment.
- Automate deployments using **GitHub Actions**.
- Structure a **DynamoDB + Lambda + API Gateway** serverless architecture.
- Manage **IAM groups, users, and roles** for least-privilege access.
- Host a small static web app on **GitHub Pages** to consume deployed APIs.

Terraform modules are customized for reusable, environment-aware setups.
For details on the modules, see my article:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions (Quick Summary)

### 1. AWS IAM Setup

Create three IAM groups:

- **Dev** ‚Üí Deny access to Terraform-tagged resources.
- **ReadOnly** ‚Üí View all resources (attach `ViewOnlyAccess` + custom policy).
- **DevOps** ‚Üí Used by Terragrunt/Terraform automation (attach assume-role policy).

Then:

- Create a **role named `Terraform`** with **AdministratorAccess**.
- Create a **user** in the **DevOps** group and generate **Access Keys** for GitHub Actions.

---

### 2. Local Terragrunt Setup

1. Clone the repo.
2. Edit:

   - **`prod/terragrunt.hcl`**

   Update the `state_prefix` with something unique to your setup.

   - **`prod/env.hcl`**

   Update the `env` variable value with something unique for proper state separation and to avoid duplicate resource errors.

3. Go to `prod/` and run:

   ```bash
   terragrunt init
   ```

   Approve creation of the backend (S3 + DynamoDB).

4. Confirm `.terraform/`, `provider.tf`, and `state.tf` are generated (auto-excluded in `.gitignore`).

---

### 3. GitHub Actions Deployment

- Push changes to a feature branch (e.g., `ultimate-dev`).
- Create a PR and merge into `main`.
- The **`deploy.yml`** workflow runs automatically to apply infrastructure.

**GitHub Secrets Required:**

```
ACCOUNT_ID
AWS_REGION
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

These belong to the DevOps IAM user and are stored under the `production` environment in repo settings.

---

### 4. Verifying Resources

- Check AWS Console ‚Üí Resources should be created as tagged by Terraform.
- Use **ReadOnly users** to inspect resources or invoke Lambda test events safely.

---

### 5. Hosting the Frontend (GitHub Pages)

- Go to **Settings ‚Üí Pages**.
- Source: `docs` branch ‚Üí `/docs` directory.
- Save ‚Üí Wait for GitHub Pages to deploy.

Then, update the **API URLs** (from Terragrunt apply outputs):

- In `index.html`: replace `apiUrl` with the `.../strength-cat` endpoint.
- In `History.html`: replace `apiUrl` with the `.../history` endpoint.

Commit and push changes to redeploy automatically.

---

### 6. Destroy Workflow

- A manual **`destroy.yml`** workflow is provided to safely tear down infrastructure.
- It first runs `terragrunt apply` to refresh outputs, then executes `terragrunt destroy` in the right order.
- Use branch protection to ensure only authorized users can trigger it.
